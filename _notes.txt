current controller implementation will have the car wandering back and forth within the lane
should pass the grader but is not ideal

autoware code artifact
does not recompute trajectory until the car has passed a certain distance away from the waypoints
or a certain angle away from the waypoint trajectory

to resolve, look at waypoint_follower C++ code
update vehicle position all the time, not just when certain distance or certain angle threshold is passed
- function to check if we're following waypoints
- if not following waypoints, update trajectory

-> modify to follow the waypoints all the time

pure_pursuit_core.cpp
line 255: set following_flag to false instead of calling verifyFollowing()



alternate fixes:
	change the yaw controller to dampen steering a bit
	add a dampening term that considers the difference between current angular velocity and target angular velocity
	if there is no difference then don't dampen steering
	if the difference is "large" then add dampening


waypoint_loader/waypoint_loader.py:
	decelerate()
	lane.header format: frame_id, stamp (current time, e.g., rospy.Time(0))
	pose.orientation based on yaw -> use Quaternion (???)

	self.velocity = self.kmph2mps(rospy.get_param('~velocity'))

    def kmph2mps(self, velocity_kmph):
        return (velocity_kmph * 1000.) / (60. * 60.)
